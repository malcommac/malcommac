### [SwiftLocation](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftLocation)
Location Manager can be painful and uselessly complex with iOS and Swift. This lightweight solution allows you to use all system's location based services (plus external services like Google Maps, MapBox, OpenStreet and Nokia Here) directly from an easy to use and elegant APIs set.  
It supports efficient & easy location tracker (single, continous, significant and visits), location by IP, gecoding/reverse geocoding, geofencing, autocomplete, beacon ranging & broadcasting.

### [Hydra](https://github.com/malcommac/Hydra)
Asynchronous programming is not an easy task in Swift (as like in ObjC). Hydra is full-featured library which allows you to write better async code. It's partially based on JavaScript A+ specs and also implements modern construct like await which allows you to write async code in sync manner. Hydra supports all sexiest operators like always, validate, timeout, retry, all, any, pass, recover, map, zip, defer and retry.

### [SwiftRichString](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftRichString)
SwiftRichString is a library which allows to create and manipulate attributed strings easily both in iOS, macOS, tvOS and even watchOS. It provides convenient way to store styles you can reuse in your app's UI elements, allows complex tag-based strings rendering and also includes integration with Interface Builder.

### [ScrollStackController](https://github.com/malcommac/ScrollStackController)
Create complex scrollable layout using UIViewControllers or plain UIViews and simplify your code!  
ScrollStackController is a class you can use to create complex layouts using scrollable UIStackView but where each row is handled by a separate UIViewController; this allows you to keep a great separation of concerns.
